# About FuzzyPics

A simple webapp that allows the user to upload a jpg or png file, scramble the image accordingly to a password, and save it. 

Still in a very early stage, this project started months ago as an attempt of encrypting by manipulating the architecture of the image, eventually failed because of the impossibility of substituting pieces of data with others without breaking the padding of the file.

Now using a canvas approach it fetch the image's pixels and selectively scrambles them.
